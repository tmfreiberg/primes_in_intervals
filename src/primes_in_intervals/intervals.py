"""Counting primes in intervals.

This module contains the project's core computations.  For an interval length
``H`` and a range ``(A, B]``, we count how many intervals of the form
``(a, a + H]`` contain exactly ``m`` primes, as ``a`` runs over

* multiples of ``H`` shifted by ``A`` ("disjoint" intervals, one count per
  block of ``H`` consecutive integers),
* every integer in ``(A, B]`` ("overlapping" intervals, a sliding window), or
* every prime in ``(A, B]`` ("prime-start" intervals).

Each counter comes in two forms: a plain form returning a single frequency
dictionary ``{m: count}``, and a checkpoint form (suffix ``_cp``) that sweeps
the primes once and records the cumulative frequencies at each element of a
checkpoint list ``C``, wrapped in a "meta-dictionary" with a ``'header'``
describing the computation and a ``'data'`` item mapping each checkpoint to its
frequency dictionary.  Sweeping once matters: prime generation dominates the
cost, and the checkpoint forms make an entire animation's worth of data
available for the price of the final frame.

The functions :func:`anyIntervals` and :func:`anyIntervals_cp` generalize all
of the above: the left endpoints ``a`` are drawn from one arbitrary strictly
increasing generator, and the objects counted inside ``(a, a + H]`` from
another.

A warning to maintainers: the sliding-window logic in :func:`overlap` and
:func:`overlap_cp`, and the endpoint handling throughout, are delicate.  The
loops advance two independent prime generators (one trailing the window's left
edge, one leading its right edge) and jump the window by runs of prime-free
integers rather than one step at a time; the closing ``while`` blocks handle
the final stretch where the trailing generator has already passed the upper
bound.  These functions are transcribed verbatim from the original project and
validated against it; do not "tidy" the arithmetic without re-running the
equivalence tests.

    The returned dictionary has an item ``m: h(m)`` for each ``m`` with
    ``h(m)`` nonzero, where ``h(m)`` is the number of integers ``a`` with
    ``A < a <= B`` such that ``(a, a + H]`` contains exactly ``m`` primes.
    Note that the first interval considered is ``(A + 1, A + 1 + H]``, so the
    first prime that can be counted is at least ``A + 2``.

    The implementation slides a window of length ``H`` and only does work when
    an endpoint crosses a prime.  Two independent prime generators are
    maintained: ``p`` (from ``P``) is always the first prime after the window's
    left endpoint ``a``, and ``q`` (from ``Q``) the first prime after its right
    endpoint ``a + H``.  Writing ``b = p - a`` and ``c = q - (a + H)``, the
    window can jump ``min(b, c) - 1`` steps with the count ``m`` unchanged;
    then, depending on which endpoint reaches its prime first, ``m`` decreases
    by one (left endpoint passes a prime), increases by one (right endpoint
    does), or stays put (both at once).  A separate closing loop handles the
    stretch after ``p`` has passed ``B``, where the jump must be truncated at
    ``B``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A, B : int

    For each ``a`` from ``generator1`` with ``M < a <= N``, count the number

    tally how many ``a`` produce each ``m``.  Both generators must yield

    A buffer ``Blist`` holds the ``b``-values currently inside the window;
